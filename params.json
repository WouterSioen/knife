{"name":"Knife","body":"#Knife\r\nThis is the Fork CLI Tool. This tool is build to make life of the developers easier.\r\n\r\n## Installing\r\nClone the repository to your local machine. (I've put it in my homedir, ~/.knife)\r\n\r\n\tgit clone git://github.com/siphoc/knife.git ~/.knife\r\n\r\nAfter you're done, add the following line of code to your ~/.bashrc file (or any other file that'll be automatically loaded. If you use my dotfiles it'll be loaded already.)\r\n\r\n\texport PATH=\"$HOME/.knife:$PATH\"\r\n\r\nNow you should be able to call the tool via the \"ft\" command.\r\n\r\n##Setting up\r\nDon't forget to setup your knife, otherwise it'll use my credits in your projects. The .ftconfig file is meant as an example.\r\n\r\n##Documentation\r\nAt the moment, the inline help function is not very helpfull yet, this is a work in progress.\r\n\r\nI've posted a [blogpost](http://siphoc.com/news/detail/knife-the-fork-cli-tool) about this on my website. It contains a small tutorial on how to use the Fork CLI Tool.\r\n\r\nThere's also a [wiki on github](https://github.com/siphoc/knife/wiki/_pages)\r\n\r\n##Possible issues\r\n\r\n### PDO Error\r\nAt the moment, I'm using plain PDO, in the future this tool will connect with Spoon. One of the errors you could\r\ncome across is that your mysql socket isn't available.\r\n\r\nThe error will be recognizable by:\r\nSQLSTATE[HY000] [2002] No such file or directory\r\n\r\nIf you come accross this problem, don't worry, don't panic. Just breath.\r\n\r\nNow, as a real ninja go to terminal(where your're obviously already in) and type vi /etc/php.ini (or wherever your php ini is, just make sure it is the one the command line uses. To check this you could type php --ini)\r\n\r\nsearch the line pdo_mysql.default_socket=/a/path/to/a/mysql.sock\r\n\r\nNow, obviously, this is the wrong path. You have 3 choices, set the path to /tmp/mysql.sock or /your/mamp/folder/mysql.sock\r\nIf this doesn't work, my last chance of saving you is this:\r\n\r\ncd /\r\nfind . -name 'mysql.sock'\r\n\r\nThis could take a while, but at the end it will show you where your mysql.sock file is. Set your path to that file\r\nand hope for the best.\r\n","tagline":"The Fork CLI Tool","google":"UA-32543363-1","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
